# Commonsbooking Statistics

This Python script will help you to get some statistics based on your [Commonsbooking](https://github.com/wielebenwir/commonsbooking) data. The source code is only intended as a starting point to do your own evaluation (see the file `evaluation.py`). You might have to adjust the code to make it work for your specific dataset, but only small adjustments should be required (e.g. something like: add more colors to a colors array if you have more than three years of data or change the names of your bookable items).

This project is especially helpful if you want to skip the annoying parsing part of the weird database tables `posts` and `postmeta` â€” where the new Commonsbooking (starting with version 2) is storing all of the bookings and corresponding data (instead of their lovely old, *separate* cb_tables beforehand) ...


## Usage

Tested with Python3.10:

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/inSPEYERed/cb-statistics.git`
- Install the Python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- In PhpMyAdmin, export the tables `<prefix>_posts` and `<prefix>_postmeta` as JSON files and put them in the `./data/` folder of this project.
- Create a `.env` file next to this Readme with the only entry `WP_TABLE_PREFIX=<your-table-prefix, e.g. wp>`.
- Run the script via `python ./src/main.py`.
- Check the folder `./plots/` to find the output (`statistics.pdf` has all the statistics combined)


## Sample result

This is one of the outcomes (currently only in Germany, but you could easily adapt that in the source code):
