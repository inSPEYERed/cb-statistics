Visit the website [here](https://inspeyered.github.io/cb-statistics/) where you can upload the timeframes/bookings you've directly exported from within WordPress (see [the docs](https://commonsbooking.org/docs/einstellungen-2/export/) on how to do this). Your data never leaves the browser; it is not uploaded to any server, so you don't have to worry about your privacy and GDPR.

# Original Python backend

_Originally, this project was only written in Python, plotting with `matplotlib` and exporting the diagrams as PDFs using `PyMuPDF`. For the Python project, you had to download some tables from PhpMyAdmin. With the [new web app](https://inspeyered.github.io/cb-statistics/), this is not necessary anymore, just upload your CSV file and that's it. No installation required._


This Python script will help you to get some statistics based on your [Commons Booking](https://github.com/wielebenwir/commonsbooking) data. The source code is only intended as a starting point to do your own evaluation (see the file `evaluation.py`). You might have to adjust the code to get the plots right for your specific dataset, but only small adjustments should be required (e.g. something like: add more colors to a colors array if you have more than three years of data), see [this file](https://github.com/inSPEYERed/cb-statistics/blob/main/src/plot_diagrams.py).

This project is especially helpful if you want to skip the annoying parsing part of the weird database tables `posts` and `postmeta` â€” where the new Commons Booking (starting with version 2) is storing all of the bookings and corresponding data (instead of their lovely old, *separate* cb_tables beforehand) ...


## Usage

Tested with Python 3.10.5:

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/inSPEYERed/cb-statistics.git`.
- Install the Python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- In PhpMyAdmin, export the tables `<prefix>_posts` and `<prefix>_postmeta` as JSON files and put them in the `./data/` folder of this project.
- Create a `.env` file next to this Readme with the only entry `WP_TABLE_PREFIX=<your-table-prefix, e.g. wp>`.
- Run the script via `python ./src/main.py`.
- Check the folder `./plots/` to find the output (`statistics.pdf` has all the statistics combined).

Feel free to open an issue if something is not working for you.


## Sample result

Currently supported plots:

- Bookings per calender week
- Bookings per weekday
- Bookings per item

This is how the bookings per weekday result can look like:
